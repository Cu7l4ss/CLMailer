## CLMailer

A simple command line emailing, with attachments and multiple email addresses support.
Use any smtp server, preferably gmail(just easier).

#### Instructions
1. Change the gmail_user and gmail_pwd variables to your own
2. Change the default message and subject strings in the defMessage variable
3. Attachments are seperated by commas

#### Prerequisites
*   Python 2.7
*   Python libraries:
    -   smtplib
    -   email

Developed and tested on Windows 7 and Python 2.7.
Since it's really the simplest form (with preinstalled libraries) no reason why it shouldn't work on other OSes
